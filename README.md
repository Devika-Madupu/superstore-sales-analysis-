# Superstore Sales Data Analysis (Python)

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the Superstore Sales Dataset to uncover trends in sales, profit, discounts, and regional performance using Python and also PowerBI for interactive visualisation. The analysis focuses on extracting business insights through data cleaning, aggregation, visualization.

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib (visualization)

Seaborn (advanced visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

PowerBI(Interactive visualization)

# Dataset

Source: Superstore Sales Dataset (kaggle)

Key Columns:

Order Year, Order Month

Sales, Profit, Discount

Category, Region

# Analysis Performed

1️) Data Cleaning & Understanding

Cleaned and transformed raw data by handling missing values, duplicates and 
Checked data type inconsistencies.

Ensured Sales and Profit columns are numeric

Resolved syntax and aggregation errors during analysis


2️) Year-wise Sales Analysis

Grouped sales by Order Year

Visualized trends using bar charts


3️) Month-wise Sales Analysis

Aggregated sales by Order Month

Identified seasonal patterns


4️) Category-wise Profit Analysis

Compared profit across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology

Found Technology to be the most profitable category


5️) Region-wise Sales & Profit Analysis

Used pie charts to show contribution (%) by region

West region contributed the highest sales and profit


6️)Correlation Analysis

Analyzed relationships between Sales, Profit, Discount

Visualized using a correlation heatmap

# Key Visualizations

Bar chart: Year-wise sales trend

Pie chart: Region-wise sales & profit contribution

Heatmap: Correlation matrix


# Business Insights

- Sales and Profit show a moderate positive correlation

- Discounts have a negative impact on profit

- Heavy discounting does not significantly increase sales

- Technology category yields the highest profit

- West region is the top-performing region

# Conclusions

Focus on high-margin categories instead of heavy discounting

Optimize discount strategies to protect profit

Invest more in high-performing regions like West


# How to Run This Project

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run cells sequentially.
